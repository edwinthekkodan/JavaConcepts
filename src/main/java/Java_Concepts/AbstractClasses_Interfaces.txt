🧱 Abstract Classes
📌 What is it?
An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes. It can have:
- Abstract methods (no body — must be implemented by child classes)
- Concrete methods (with body — shared logic)
- Variables (both static and instance)
🧪 Example:
abstract class Employee {
    String name;
    abstract void work(); // abstract method

    void attendMeeting() {
        System.out.println(name + " is attending a meeting.");
    }
}


✅ Use Case:
When you want to define a base class with partial implementation — like a generic Employee class that different roles (Manager, Developer) can extend.

🔌 Interfaces
📌 What is it?
An interface is a contract — it defines what a class must do, but not how. It only contains:
- Abstract methods (implicitly public and abstract)
- Constants (implicitly public, static, final)
- From Java 8+, it can also have default and static methods
🧪 Example:
interface Workable {
    void work(); // abstract method
}


✅ Use Case:
When you want to define capabilities that can be shared across unrelated classes — like Workable, Printable, Clickable.

💼 Real-World Analogy
- Abstract Class: Like a company policy document — it gives structure and some rules, but leaves room for department-specific details.
- Interface: Like a job description — it tells you what tasks must be done, but not how to do them.
