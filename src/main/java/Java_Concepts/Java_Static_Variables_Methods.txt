🧠 What Does "Static" Mean in Java?
In Java, static means shared — like a common resource that belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects.

🔧 Static Variables (aka Class Variables)
📌 Definition:
A static variable is a single copy of a variable that is shared by all objects of a class.
✅ Use Case:
When you want to store data that’s common to all objects, like a counter or a company name.
🧪 Example:
class Employee {
    static String companyName = "TechCorp"; // shared by all employees
    String name;

    Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}


🎯 Key Points:
- Only one copy exists, no matter how many objects you create.
- You can access it using the class name: Employee.companyName.

⚙️ Static Methods
📌 Definition:
A static method belongs to the class, not to any object. You can call it without creating an object.
✅ Use Case:
When the method doesn’t need to use any instance variables (i.e., it works independently of object state).
🧪 Example:
class MathUtils {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


You can call it like this:
int result = MathUtils.add(5, 3);


🎯 Key Points:
- Can only access static variables and other static methods directly.
- Useful for utility functions (like Math.pow() or Integer.parseInt()).

🧩 Real-World Analogy
Think of a static variable like a shared whiteboard in a classroom — everyone can see and update it.
A static method is like a public announcement — it doesn’t depend on who’s listening, it just delivers info.
